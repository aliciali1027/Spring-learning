Why Spring？
====

Spring in a Nutshell: 简而言之
Spring is a popular framework for building Java application
It is initially a simpler and lighweight alternative to J2EE
It provides a large number of helper class to make enterprise development easier.

##What about J2EE?
====
J2EE has:
Client-Side Presentation
Server-side Presentation with JSP, servlets, XML and web services
Server-side Business Logic using Enterprise JavaBeans, web services
Databases

What should we do?
====
Should learn both Spring and Java EE

What's new in Spring 5?
====
The core features of Spring 4 remain the same:
Inversion of Control
Dependency Injection
Spring AOP
Spring MVC

Spring Website - Official
www.spring.io

Spring Core Framework 
Why Spring? 
- Simplify Java Enterprise Development

Goals of Spring
====
Lightweight development with Java POJOs (Plain-Old-Java-Objects)
Dependency injection to promote loose coupling
Declarative programming with Aspect-Oriented-Programming (AOP) 面向方面的编程
Minimize boilerplate Java code 引用 - with helper class

###Core Container:
====
Beans, Core, SpEL, Context
It has a bean factory for creating beans
Manage bean dependencies

Infrastructure:
====
AOP, Aspects, Instrumentation, Messaging

Add a config
====
Instrumentation - Java agents to remotely monitor your app with JMX (Java Management Extension)

Data Access Layer-This is for communicating with Databases
====
JDBC, ORM, Transactions, OXM, JMS
JDBC - JDBC Helper class - Spring JDBC classes reduce the JDBC code by 50%
ORM - Object to Relational Mapping - Integration with Hibernate and JPA
Transactions - Add transaction support - Makes heavy use of AOP behind the scenes
JMS - Java Message Service - for sending async messages to a Message Broker

Web Layer - The home to build web applications
====
Servlet, WebSocket, Web, Portlet
All web related classes
It is the home of the Spring MVC framework

Test Layer 
====
Unit, Integration, Mock
Supports Test-Driven-Development (TDD)
Mock objects and out-of-container testing

Spring Platform
====
What are Spring "Projects"?
Spring projects are additional Spring modules built-on top of the core Spring framework
You only use what you need:
Spring Cloud, Spring Data
Spring Batch, Spring Security
Spring for Android, Spring Web Flow
Spring Web Services, Spring LDAP

Java Application Server - Tomcat
Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - Eclipse

Download Java JAR files:

Window - Perspective - Open Perspective - Java
Then File - New - Java Project
Name it as spring-demo-one
Then download the JAR files:
http://repo.spring.io/release/org/springframework/spring/
Choose the latest released on and the release-dist.zip
Open - libs - Copy all the JAR files
Then create a new folder called lib in the project
Pasge the JAR files in the lib
Then right click the project - Properties - Java Build Path - Add JARs

THEN select all the JAR file and apply all of them
